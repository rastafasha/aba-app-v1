    <p>
      Specific duties and responsibilities: Collect data on target behaviors
      identified for reduction/acquisition/replacement, implement the behavior
      program and train the caregivers on data collection and implementation of
      the procedures outline within the plan.<br />
      Work Schedule and Schedule of activities: Behavior assistant will work
      with consumer Monday-Saturday, times vary. During that time all programs
      will be implemented. <br />
      Ongoing Assessment Responsibilities: Behavior Assistant will be
      responsible for collection of ongoing ABC data that will be used to assess
      the continued efficacy of the program/ interventions. Behavior Assistant
      will also record data sheets provided and attached to the program Training
      Procedures for Caregivers: Following competency based training by the
      behavior analyst of the caregivers with regards to the interventions
      outline within the behavior program, the behavior assistant will complete
      competency checks of the caregivers’ ability to collect data, implement
      replacement programs and follow through on the interventions.<br />
      Competency checks will include demonstration/modeling of procedures,
      observation of caregiver implementing replacement/acquisition programs, as
      well as corrective feedback when warranted.
