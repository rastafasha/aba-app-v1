            <h4>Family / Caregiver Involvement</h4>
            <p>
              â€œAll training provided is in relevant context/routines to
              caregivers supporting client once on-going treatment begins.
              During visit, clinicians will teach and train the behavior plan to
              caregivers. The behavior analyst will describe, model, and/or
              prompt use of the procedures, making sure that the interventions
              fit well within existing routines and are feasible. The
              expectation is that the caregiver or school staff will initially
              be implementing the plan with the assistance and support of the
              behavior assistant. If necessary, behavioral staff will provide
              simplified versions of the behavior and teaching plans to
              facilitate implementation. The analyst will observe caregivers and
              provide feedback, gradually fading the assistance they provide.
              Parent training will occur weekly by the BCBA but modeling of
              appropriate interventions and procedures will occur daily by
              RBT/lead analyst, depending on who is providing the service. All
              implementation of fidelity procedures, data collection, and
              analyzing of data will occur under the direction and guidance of
              the lead analyst; revisions will occur as needed. Participation by
              the parents or caregivers are expected, and continued
              authorization for ABA services will take consideration of their
              participation in at least 85% of planned sessions.Teaching
              Methods: To develop the acquisition skills and replacement
              behaviors, the behavioral intervention professionals and
              caregivers will task analyze complex skills, develop
              routine-specific instructional plans, and use appropriate
              chaining, shaping, and prompting methods. Specifically, these will
              include natural environment training, incidental or milieu
              teaching, peer mediated instruction, and role play-based
              intervention. Teaching plans will be developed for complex skills
              and will include the environments in which the instruction is
              taking place. These teaching plans will include the specific
              skills or skill sequences to be taught, environmental arrangements
              to promote skill use (e.g., social stories, videos, token boards,
              timers, visual schedules), and other specific instructional
              procedures. Routines and skills targeted for instruction will be
              prioritized by the caregivers, addressing the most essential areas
              first. Caregivers will be taught a variety of behavior
              interventions throughout the session. This will allow parents to
              successfully work with client and any of his problem behaviors
              when the behavior assistant and analyst are not present. Ongoing
              training and monitoring will continue to occur on a weekly basis
              to ensure proper implementation of the behavior program. Each
              month, clinicians will conduct competency checks of the caregivers
              to ensure proper program implementation."
