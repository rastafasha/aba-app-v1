          Implementation of this intervention plan could be affected by the
          following: not consistent implementation of behavior plan by program
          implementers (caregivers, therapists). In an effort to overcome these
          barriers, we will monitor caregivers/ staff to ensure that the
          implementation of the programs is occurring on consistent and
          appropriate basis. It is also important to avoid gaps in services to
          avoid disrupting progress or failing to acquire functional skills. In
          addition, maladaptive behaviors that put consumer at risk might
          escalate if treatment is withheld.

          Clientâ€™s maladaptive behaviors can have negative social consequences
          as others may avoid interaction with the client. Client needs close
          monitoring and external regulation. Non-compliance, prevents client
          from engaging in the acquisition of new behaviors that would foster
          learning, instruction following, independence and habituation to
          rule-bound settings, which pose subsequent risks. Maladaptive
          behaviors reduce opportunities for learning new things and interacting
          with peers. Helping Client communicate their needs, understand
          instructions and demands and regulate impulsive behavior is imperative
          to successful functioning in home, school and community settings.

          Caregivers are to be trained on possible effects of treatment
          modalities such as Extinction Burst. Common effects of this
          intervention are an increase in the frequency of the target response
          (extinction burst) and increase in aggression (extinction-induced
          aggression). If parents/caregivers are not adequately trained to
          understand the process, they usually think that treatment is not
          working and make efforts to stop these interventions.

          Punishment procedures are not used in this program and least
          restrictive strategies are always encouraged first. In the case that
          Response Cost or Simple Corrections are used, procedures will be
          described and all people involved in treatment will learn and
          demonstrate how to use them and what the contingencies will be.
