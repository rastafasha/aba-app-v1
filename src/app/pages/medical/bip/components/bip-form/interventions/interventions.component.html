                            Differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors
                            will involve delivery of reinforcement each time the
                            alternative behavior occurs while extinguishing
                            problem behavior. Initially, reinforcement (praise,
                            small edibles, access to tangibles) will be provided
                            on a continuous schedule and then thinned to an
                            intermittent schedule.

                            This will be used to redirect the consumer to
                            alternative activities when she engages in
                            elopement, Physical aggression, etc. Redirection
                            will be used either during precursor behaviors or
                            after a period of no maladaptives if a maladaptive
                            behavior has occurred.

                          <p>
                            When Client attempts to engage in aggression,
                            elopement, caregiver will use response block to
                            prevent it, while minimizing eye contact and
                            talking. The response block should not last for more
                            than 15 seconds. This technique does not involve
                            restraint. Problem behavior responses are blocked
                            without grabbing the individual. The parent and
                            behavior analyst will block by placing their arm or
                            open hand between Client and the area being

                            Client will engage in high-probability behavior,
                            contingent upon completing programming, or chores
                            (less probability behavior). Restricting the
                            high-probability activity to below baseline rates
                            will increase its reinforcing efficacy. To ensure
                            that the high-probability activity will function as
                            a reinforcer, this activity will only be available
                            contingent upon the completion of the
                            low-probability activity.
